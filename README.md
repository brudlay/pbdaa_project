# Processing Big Data For Analytics Applications

## Final Project - NYC EMS and Fire Dispatch Analysis

In this repository is my own code for my final project in the PBDAA class at NYU. The project focuses on analytics and insights for Emergency Services Dispatch in New York City.

I worked with an [EMS](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj) dataset from NYC Open Data while my partner worked on the Fire dataset. 

Here are the contents of this repository:
- [Data](data/instructions.md)
- [Cleaning Code](Cleaning)
- [Profiling](Profiling)
- [Analytics](Analytics)
- [Hive](Hive)

Inside the data folder consists of the EMS dataset I obtained from NYC Open Data.

Inside the Cleaning, Profiling, and Analytics folders are the .java, .class, and .jar files required to run the MapReduce programs I wrote for each purpose. 

Inside the Hive folder consists of a .txt of the commands I used to run the Hive queries.

Thank you.
