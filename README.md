# Processing Big Data For Analytics Applications

## Final Project - NYC EMS and Fire Dispatch Analysis

In this repository is my own code for my final project in the PBDAA class at NYU. The project focuses on analytics and insights for Emergency Services Dispatch in New York City.

I worked with an [EMS](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/EMS-Incident-Dispatch-Data/76xm-jjuj) dataset from NYC Open Data while my partner worked on the Fire dataset. 

Here are the contents of this repository:
- [Cleaning Code](Cleaning) ~ .java, .class, and .jar files required to run the Cleaning MapReduce program
- [Profiling](Profiling) ~ .java, .class, and .jar files required to run the CountRecs MapReduce program
- [Analytics](Analytics) ~ .java, .class, and .jar files required to run the Analytics MapReduce program as well as output .csv file
- [Hive](Hive) ~ .txt file of the commands I used to run the Hive queries

As the dataset is around 5.61GB and is too big to upload onto GitHub, I have omitted the file in this repository but have linked the dataset above.

Thank you.
